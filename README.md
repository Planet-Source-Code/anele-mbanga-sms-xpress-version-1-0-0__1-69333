### Description

Access sim card/phone to read, delete, copy, export phonebook entries and sms messages and also send a sms to the limit of 320 characters to another cellphone user. Read the signal strength of the cellphone/modem. The readmefirst.txt has a detailed explaination of what the gsm.ocx does in detail. You connect to a modem via a comm port and most of the operations are via AT commands. A timer is used to get the result of the modem and results are returned via same function eg. gsm.PhoneBook_ListView will list your sim card/cellphone phonebook entries to the named listview and PhoneBook_Export will export your sim card / phone phone book entries to a csv file. Experience it for yourself and please dont forget to vote. This code does not use a compiled ocx but the GSM.ocx has been developed purely for handling almost everything about communication with the sim card / phone.
